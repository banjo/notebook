# CSS

## Advanced 
Based on the course from FreeCodeCamp called Applied Visual Design.

### Psuedo classes
Use psudo classes to access specific parts of an element.

#### Hover class
This class gets activated when the mouse hovers over said element.
The object is black from the beginning, and turns blue when hovered over.

```h
<style>
  a {
    color: #000;
  }
  a:hover {
    color: blue;
  } 
</style>
```
